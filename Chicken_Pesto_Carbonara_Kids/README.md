# Chicken Pesto "Carbonara" for Kids

## Ingredients

1 (+/-) lb of any kind of pasta.  My kids prefer Anelli if you can find it, but I've made it with about half a dozen different kinds and it seems to work fine (examples: Bucantini, Orecchiette, really whatever).

Some chicken, maybe 1/2 lb, boneless and cut into bite sized pieces

Italian seasoning of some kind

3 strips bacon

3 tbsp pesto

1 handful romano

Black pepper to taste (I use a big pinch)

2 eggs

## Process

Bring water to boil with some salt

Fry 3 strips bacon in whatever pan

Remove bacon, place on cutting board

Cook chicken in bacon grease and add italian seasoning, add the pesto about 1/2 way through and maybe a bit of salt 

When the bacon is cool enough, chop it into thin strips

Cook pasta

Beat eggs

When chicken is almost done, add romano, return bacon to its now chickeny home (put it in the pot too)

### This is the only time in this whole recipe you have to pay attention:

#### When the pasta is done boiling -- you have to move quickly.  The rest of this recipe needs to come together fast to cook the eggs properly, so focus and do the next three steps in about 40 seconds

Strain the pasta, and dump it back into the original pot, again -- quickly! (Note that the burner is off and the sole source of heat here is hot pasta.  

Then dump the eggs and the chicken mix into the pasta and stir like crazy for about 20 seconds.  I let my kids use powertools (with supervision), but I'd advise against letting them do this step.  Two words: *Salmonella enterica* 

I typically put the lid back on for about 90 seconds while I try to communicate to my children that it is dinner time.  For those of you that know me, Im probably the loudest person you know and they still dont hear me.  Unless they remember what we are having.
