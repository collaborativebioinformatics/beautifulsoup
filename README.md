## Soup 1 -- [Chicken pesto "carbonara" -- for kids!](https://github.com/collaborativebioinformatics/beautifulsoup/blob/main/Chicken_Pesto_Carbonara_Kids/README.md)

### Note: I thought the first "soup" posted would be fancier, but I wanted to share this with other parents because my kids, who often have divergent eating preferences, will both ask for thirds of this.  Also, this is an easy 25 minute meal with little cleanup.
